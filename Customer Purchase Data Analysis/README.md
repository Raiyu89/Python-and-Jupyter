📊 Customer Purchase Data Analysis (Python & Pandas)

📌 Project Overview

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) exercise on a synthetic customer purchase dataset. The objective is to practice core data-science skills including:

- Data ingestion and inspection

- Descriptive statistics

- Data filtering and querying

- Aggregation and value counts

- Conditional subsetting using Pandas

The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (Cust_Purch_Data_Exercise.ipynb) using Python and Pandas, working with a structured CSV dataset (Cust_Purch_FakeData.csv).

🔍 What the Notebook Covers

The notebook walks through a series of practical data-analysis questions, including:

✔ Loading and inspecting the dataset
✔ Understanding dataset shape (rows & columns)
✔ Computing summary statistics (min, max, mean age)
✔ Identifying the most common customer names
✔ Detecting duplicate phone numbers
✔ Filtering by profession (Structural Engineer)
✔ Gender-based segmentation
✔ Locating female structural engineers in Alberta (AB)

These tasks mirror real-world data-analysis workflows often used in business analytics and customer insights projects.
